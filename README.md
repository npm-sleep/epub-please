## ‚öôÔ∏è Rendering DPI Explained

The DPI (Dots Per Inch) setting controls the resolution of the images generated for each page of your PDF. Higher DPI means better quality but larger file sizes.

*   **150 DPI:** Good balance for general reading on most devices. Smaller file size.
*   **300 DPI:** (Default) Higher quality, suitable for documents with fine details or for viewing on high-resolution screens. Larger file size.
*   **600 DPI:** Very high quality, often unnecessary unless source PDF has extremely fine details or requires archival quality. Significantly larger file size.

Choose the DPI based on your needs for quality versus storage space/portability.
